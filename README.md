# Hello! Welcome to my Github profile. :sunglasses:
## My name is Geovana and my nickname is geo / byul!âš¡
I'm a computer science student! I'm currently searching for an opportunity to learn and to code more! I'm learning about Fullstack Java and C# for now, but I'm really willing to learn more about my goals (Cibersecurity and Data Science). :rocket:
I really like to learn so it'll have some repositories with others programming languages, just for fun haha :laughing:
